# CS4360 Team App

## Overview
This project is developed by the CS4360 team at MSU Denver. It demonstrates a mobile app designed to optimize parking experiences for users by offering features such as real-time parking availability, cost-effective planning tools, and integration with multiple APIs for a seamless user experience.

The app is aimed at students, staff, and visitors at MSU Denver, as well as those attending events at the Ball Arena.

## AMP’s Vision: Transforming the Parking Experience Beyond MSU Denver
AMP (Auraria Mobile Parking) was conceived as part of a senior experience course at MSU Denver, where a dedicated team of students envisioned a solution to improve parking efficiency on the Auraria Campus. As a project born from collaboration and innovation, AMP began with a simple, yet powerful goal: to create an intuitive, efficient, and comprehensive mobile solution for students, staff, faculty, and visitors. Since its inception, AMP has evolved from an academic exercise to a fully realized tool that empowers users to seamlessly navigate and manage parking.

But AMP is not just about the present—it’s about growth. AMP’s future potential is limitless. With continued development, the app can expand beyond the Auraria Campus, providing real-time parking management to other universities, cities, and organizations looking to streamline their parking solutions. The groundwork laid by the founding team sets a clear direction for the future: AMP has the power to become a transformative platform that redefines parking management across multiple regions. Thanks to the foundation created by the team, AMP is ready to grow, innovate, and adapt, providing unparalleled benefits for urban mobility solutions.

As AMP continues its journey, its potential to evolve into a global parking management solution will be driven by the expertise and collaboration of computer scientists, engineers, developers, and innovators. These professionals will be instrumental in nurturing AMP’s growth, scaling it across regions, and adapting it to meet the needs of an ever-changing world.
